### Seed Storage

The Seed Storage feature allows you to keep track of your seed inventory. You can record details about each seed packet, such as the type of plant, variety, quantity, and any additional notes.

### Harvest Tracker

With the Harvest Tracker, you can monitor and record all the produce that comes out of your garden during the growing season. This feature enables you to track the quantity and value of your harvests, giving you insights into the productivity of your garden. It's a useful tool for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of growing your own food.

### Gardening Calendar

The Gardening Calendar feature helps you plan and manage your gardening activities throughout the year. You can visualize the sowing, transplant, growing, and harvest periods for all of your crops, allowing you to plan succession plantings and optimize your garden's productivity.

### Task Manager

The Task Manager feature allows you to set tasks and reminders for yourself. You can create to-do lists and assign specific tasks to different dates. The app sends text notifications to your phone as reminders, ensuring you stay on top of your gardening tasks and never forget an important activity.
